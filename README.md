# Suite Cloud

Suite Cloud is the app that runs the mail servers behind [Frappe Suite](https://github.com/frappe/suite).
It sets up [Stalwart](https://stalw.art) mail clusters, keeps them configured, and lets many Suite
tenants share one cluster safely.

## How it works, in short

- **A Suite Tenant** records each Suite tenant: the cluster it uses, its limits and the key and
  secret the tenant authenticates with.
- **A Suite tenant** never talks to the mail server's admin API itself. When it wants to add a
  domain, create a mailbox, change a password and so on, it asks Suite Cloud. Suite Cloud checks
  that the tenant owns what it is touching, saves the change in its own records, and pushes it to
  the cluster in the same step.
- **End users** (the people reading and sending mail) connect straight to the cluster with their
  own app passwords. Suite Cloud is not in that path.
- **Operators** use the desk to create clusters, add servers, manage DNS and watch jobs.

```

The app has two modules, so one CODEOWNERS line can cover each product:

| Module | Folder | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Suite Cloud** | `suite_cloud/suite_cloud` | What every hosted product shares: DNS Zone, DNS Record, Server Job, Suite Tenant, Suite Cloud Settings, plus `provisioning` (Ansible over SSH) and `dns` (provider client, resolver). |
| **Mail** | `suite_cloud/mail` | The mail product: Stalwart Store, Cluster, Node, Egress Gateway and IP Pool, the mail directory (Mail Domain, Mail Account, Mail Group, Mailing List), and the `stalwart`, `cluster` and `tenancy` packages. |

The tenant-facing API is split the same way: `suite_cloud.api.tenant` for what any product needs
(authentication, `ping`, the tenant profile) and `suite_cloud.api.mail` for the mail directory.

## The pieces

| Record | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| **DNS Zone** | A domain you own (for example `frappemail.com`) plus the login for the DNS provider that manages it. Suite Cloud publishes server records there. You can have several zones; each cluster picks one. |
| **Stalwart Store** | Where a cluster keeps its data: a PostgreSQL or MySQL database, an S3 bucket for message bodies, Redis for shared memory, and optionally a search engine. |
| **Stalwart Cluster** | One mail service with its public hostname (`mail.c1.frappemail.com`), its stores, its admin credentials, an SSH key for its servers and the regions Frappe Cloud may place tenants from. |
| **Stalwart Node** | One server (VPS) that runs Stalwart for a cluster. Nodes share the same stores, so any node can serve any user. |
| **Egress Gateway** and **Egress IP Pool** | Optional extra servers used only for sending. A pool is a set of IP addresses; a domain, a tenant or a whole cluster can be told to send through it. |
| **DNS Record** | One record Suite Cloud keeps in a zone (a node's address, the cluster's round-robin entry, the SPF list, and so on). Records are created and removed together with the thing that needs them. |
| **Server Job** | One run of an install or update script on a node or gateway, with the result of every step. Secrets are looked up when the job runs and never stored in it. |
| **Suite Tenant** | One hosted Frappe Suite site: which cluster it uses, its secret, its title and contact email, and its limits (domains, accounts, groups, lists, total disk). Its id is the TXT value its domains are verified with. |
| **Mail Domain, Mail Account, Mail Group, Mailing List** | The mail directory of a tenant. Saving one of these pushes it to the cluster in the same step, so the records and the cluster never drift apart. Each carries the id Stalwart gave it. |
| **DMARC Report** | One DMARC aggregate report another receiver sent about a domain, copied hourly from the cluster that intercepted it (Stalwart parses reports mailed to `postmaster@`). Attributed to the tenant that holds the domain, and only when the report was addressed to one of that tenant's domains; kept for the configured retention, and read by tenants through the API. |
| **TLS Report** | One TLS aggregate report (RFC 8460) a sending server made about delivering to a domain: sessions that negotiated TLS as the domain's MTA-STS or DANE policy asks, sessions that failed and why. Copied, attributed, kept and served the same way as DMARC reports, with its own retention; a report whose policies name more than one domain is shown to no tenant. |
| **Suite Cloud Settings** | Defaults: DNS time-to-live, Stalwart version and download URLs, certificate settings, the public URL of this Suite Cloud, job timeout. |

## Install

```sh
bench get-app https://github.com/frappe/suite_cloud
bench --site yoursite install-app suite_cloud
```

Ansible comes with the app: `pyproject.toml` pins it, with the `community.general` collection the
firewall steps use, and Server Jobs run that copy even when the host has its own. The bench host
only needs an SSH client (`apt install openssh-client`; Frappe Cloud installs it from
`pyproject.toml`).

Installing creates two roles and one user:

- **Suite Cloud Manager**: operators who use the desk.
- **Suite Tenant**: the API-only role of the service user, with no access to any record. The
  endpoints check ownership themselves.
- A service user that every tenant request runs as.

## Setting up a cluster, step by step

1. **Settings.** Enter the email address that should receive certificate notices. While testing,
   switch the ACME directory to the Let's Encrypt staging URL so you do not hit rate limits.
2. **DNS Zone.** Create a zone for the domain your servers will live under (`frappemail.com`) and
   enter the DNS provider credentials for it. Mark it as the default. Add more zones later if some
   clusters should live under a different domain.
3. **Stores.** Create a PostgreSQL (or MySQL) data store, an S3 blob store and a Redis in-memory
   store. Redis also coordinates the nodes. RocksDB and local files only work for a single-node
   cluster.
4. **Cluster.** Create a Stalwart Cluster. Give it a short label, or leave it blank to get `c1`,
   `c2` and so on. The label and the zone make the hostname, `mail.c1.frappemail.com`, and the
   default domain `c1.frappemail.com` that nodes, gateways and pools get their names under. The
   label is only a namespace: a cluster may have servers in several regions. List the regions
   Frappe Cloud may place tenants from, or none to serve every region. Copy the SSH public key.
5. **First node.** Put that public key on a fresh VPS and set the reverse DNS (PTR) of its IP to the
   node's hostname. Create a Stalwart Node (`n1.c1.frappemail.com` with its IPv4), click
   **Verify SSH**, then **Provision**. The first Verify SSH records the server's host keys; every
   later connection must match them, and a changed address or port asks for a fresh verification. The job installs Stalwart and its CLI, sets up the system
   service and firewall, starts Stalwart once to write the store settings, applies the cluster
   configuration (roles, coordinator, certificate provider, wildcard certificate, system settings),
   and restarts it normally with the temporary admin credential removed.
6. **Finish bootstrap.** Once the certificate is issued, **Finish Bootstrap** (also tried every
   five minutes) creates the management API key and marks the cluster **Active**. The cluster
   hostname now points at this node.
7. **More nodes.** Create and provision them the same way. They only receive the database
   connection; everything else is read from the shared database. A node is added to the cluster
   hostname's DNS as soon as Stalwart reports it active.

Day-to-day buttons: **Drain** takes a node out of DNS before maintenance, **Upgrade Nodes** rolls a
new Stalwart version out one node at a time, **Sync Config** pushes the generated configuration
again, and **Check Drift** reports what differs from it without changing anything.

### Adopting a server that already has a directory

A Stalwart that a Suite tenant administered directly, before Suite Cloud, holds domains, accounts,
groups and lists that Suite Cloud never created. Register it as a cluster, create the Suite Tenant
for it, then use **Adopt Directory** on the Suite Tenant (or run
`suite_cloud.mail.tenancy.adopt.adopt_directory` with the tenant name). Every object on the
cluster is recorded with the id it already has, and nothing is pushed back. The cluster must serve
that one tenant, since nothing on it says which tenant an object belongs to; an object whose record
already exists anywhere is skipped, and each object imports on its own, so one that cannot (an
alias on a domain the tenant does not own, say) is reported while the rest go in. Adopted domains
are marked verified; adopted accounts and groups keep the cluster's quotas. Passwords and app
passwords stay on the cluster and keep working.

### Sending through dedicated IPs

1. Create an Egress Gateway (`out1.c1.frappemail.com`) on a VPS that already has the extra public
   IPs configured, and provision it.
2. Create an Egress IP Pool listing those IPs with a hostname for each (`ded1.c1.frappemail.com`,
   with reverse DNS set at the provider).
3. Assign the pool to a Mail Domain, to a Suite Tenant, or as the cluster default.

Mail from the matching sender domains is relayed to the gateway over an authenticated, encrypted
connection and leaves from the pool's addresses. The `spf.c1.frappemail.com` record that customer
domains include always lists every node and pool address, so SPF stays valid whichever path a
message takes.

## API

Suite Cloud serves one REST API at `/api/v2/method/suite_cloud.api.<module>.<method>`, documented in [docs/api](docs/api/README.md).

The **tenant API** lets a Suite Tenant manage its own domains, accounts, groups, mailing lists and DMARC and TLS reports. The tenant authenticates with its id and secret in an `Authorization: Tenant <id>:<secret>` header; it only ever sees its own objects, and a request from outside its allowed addresses is refused.

The verb follows the method name (`list_` and `get_` are GETs, `update_` a PATCH, `set_` a PUT, `delete_` and `remove_` a DELETE, the rest POSTs), parameters travel as JSON, the result sits under `data`, and an error answers `{"errors": [{"type", "message"}]}` with a REST status code. Each tenant may make 300 requests per minute.

### How a domain goes live

1. The tenant calls `check_domain`. Nothing is stored yet: the answer is a TXT record the domain
   owner must publish at the apex, `frappe-suite-verification=<tenant id>`. The id is fixed for
   the life of the tenant, so every domain it adds asks for the same record and no other tenant
   can produce it. This is what keeps one tenant from claiming another tenant's domain on a shared
   cluster. Operators adding a domain from the desk vouch for it themselves and skip this step.
   So does a cloud with **Skip Domain Verification** on in Suite Cloud Settings: it takes a
   tenant's word for its domains, which also count as verified without the DNS check below -
   for a development cloud, whose test domains exist in no public DNS, never for a shared one.
   Turning it off re-checks the domains it vouched for, so one without records goes offline.
2. Once the record resolves, `create_domain` creates the Mail Domain and the domain on the
   cluster, disabled.
3. `get_dns_records` lists what the owner must publish next: an MX record pointing at the
   cluster, an SPF record of the form `v=spf1 include:spf.<zone> -all`, the DKIM keys Stalwart
   generated for the domain, and DMARC and TLS reporting records. The rows come from Stalwart's
   `dnsZoneFile`, with SPF rewritten so egress gateways are covered. Stalwart generates and holds
   the keys; they use fixed selectors, `frappemail-rsa` and `frappemail-ed25519`, and never rotate,
   so the records an owner publishes stay valid for the life of the domain. Should a key leak,
   **Replace DKIM Keys** on the Mail Domain (and on a cluster or gateway, for their own domains)
   generates new keys under the same selectors; the owner republishes the records, and the domain
   is offline from the next hourly check until they resolve.
4. The owner publishes them. `verify_dns_records` checks on public resolvers; once SPF, DMARC and
   at least one DKIM selector resolve, the domain is verified. MX is optional: a domain may use the
   cluster for sending only.
5. A domain is **active** when it is enabled and verified; only then does Stalwart accept mail for
   it, and only then may the tenant create accounts, groups and lists on it. Disabling a domain drops
   its verification on purpose, so enabling it again needs a fresh check.
6. Verification is retried every hour, and a DKIM key the cluster was still generating when the
   records were read is picked up hourly. A temporary DNS failure never turns a working domain off.
   **Skip Scheduled Verification** on the Mail Domain keeps a domain out of the hourly check, so
   one a manager verified by hand stays verified; **Verify DNS Records** still runs on demand.

A domain carries three delivery settings a tenant may change: a catch-all address for local parts
that match no account, sub-addressing (`user+tag@`), and relaying, which makes the cluster forward
mail for addresses it does not hold to the domain's MX instead of rejecting it, so a domain can
keep some mailboxes on another server (split delivery). Relayed mail leaves like any other the
cluster sends, through the egress pool of its sender when there is one.

Records for mail client auto-setup (SRV, autoconfig, MTA-STS) are listed only when the domain has
`publish_client_discovery_records` turned on, because the cluster has no certificate for customer
hostnames.

## Configuration

Every value in Suite Cloud Settings can also be placed in `site_config.json` under a `suite_cloud`
key. When both are set, the settings record wins.

```json
{ "suite_cloud": { "acme_contact_email": "ops@example.com", "stalwart_version": "v0.16.20" } }
```

On a development site that talks to a cluster with a staging certificate, set
`suite_cloud.verify_stalwart_tls` to `false`.

## Scheduled work

| When | What |
| --- | --- |
| Every 5 minutes | Retry failed Server Jobs; poll nodes that are provisioning or draining. |
| Hourly | Verify unverified domains, except those set to skip it; refresh the DNS records of domains whose DKIM keys are not all stored yet; copy the DMARC and TLS reports each cluster received since the last run. |
| Daily | Verify every DNS Record in the zones; check every cluster for configuration drift; check the PTR records of nodes and pool addresses; drop DMARC and TLS reports older than their retention. |

## Development

```sh
bench --site yoursite run-tests --app suite_cloud --test-category all
```

Tests live next to their module: `suite_cloud/tests` for the generic app (settings, fixtures)
and `suite_cloud/mail/tests` for mail, including the fake Stalwart
(`suite_cloud/mail/tests/fake_stalwart.py`), an in-process JMAP management server the real
client talks to unchanged. Nothing reaches a real server or a real DNS provider. Tests that create
tenants use names under `.frappe.test` and clean up only those, so they can run on a site that also
holds real clusters.

The fake keeps the routes it is sent but cannot follow them, so `test_delivery` starts a Stalwart
of its own to see where they take a message: from a temporary directory, on loopback ports, with
a local sink as its only way out. It needs a `stalwart` on `PATH` of the version new clusters
install and is skipped without one; CI installs it.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs one job per module folder (Core, Mail) plus Ruff, so a
future product adds a matrix entry rather than a workflow.

The bootstrap path has been run end to end against a real single-node cluster on Stalwart
v0.16.20 (DigitalOcean DNS, Let's Encrypt wildcard certificate through DNS-01). Lessons that
are now built in: Stalwart encodes every `Set` as `{"value": true}` and every `List` as an
index-keyed object; secrets are `{"@type": "Value", "secret": ...}` unions; Let's Encrypt
rejects a wildcard order that also names a host it covers; the built-in roles are provisioned
only on a normal start that finds no Role objects, so the recovery-stage plan creates none;
bootstrap's admin password is never disclosed, so the recovery-stage plan sets it; the first
normal start fails without the cluster role it names and imports the spam filter rules once,
from the latest release unless told otherwise, so a short recovery stage before it creates the
roles, points DNS at Unbound and pins the release the server supports; and Stalwart queries
all its DNS servers by measured speed rather than in order, so nodes resolve through a local
Unbound only (a public fallback would answer too, and blocklists refuse public resolvers).

Still unverified on a live server: the egress gateway (relay listeners, connection strategy),
multi-node registry leases with a Redis coordinator, and node upgrades.
